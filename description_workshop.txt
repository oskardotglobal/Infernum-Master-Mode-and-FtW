This mod removes Calamity Infernum Mode limitations that disable you to play it with Master Mode and For the Worthy secret seed enabled.

It only doesn't let you play Infernum with Eternity in Classic worlds, if world has either Master Mode or For the Worthy this limitation does not apply any longer. This is a bad idea to try to play Infernum with Eternity since they both change bosses AI, don't do it.
